# Holidaze - Project Exam 2

For my final project exam at Noroff spring semester 2022, we were tasked with creating a website for an accommodation booking service called Holidaze.

## Description
The goal of this project was to create both customer-facing and admin pages, using an own publicly hosted API. The customers can search for accommodation names and get a dropdown linking to each individual page, or they can view all available accommodations on the browse page. Some featured accommodations are also displayed on the home page. Each individual page gives you all information about the hotel, and has the option to make an enquiry to that specific hotel. There is also an option to send messages directly to the Holidaze administration through the contact form. All forms have necessary validation.

Using JWT tokens, you can log in and view the admin pages. An updated navigation bar will give options to add new accommodations, as well as viewing all incoming messages and enquiries from customers.
